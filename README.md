== King of the HFT (App)

Android App to manage your locations, check-in to them, view them on a map and receive notification. More features
will be coming soon.

Students of the Hochschule f√ºr Technik Stuttgart will use this Android App in conjunction with the server to
check in to hidden places inside the campus. (First version. We plan to expand this to a global scale after the first
beta tests)

== Beta phase

Once a majority of students of the same course of studies check into that location, that location becomes theirs.
Once the majority of locations in the vicinity of a building belong to a single course, the building becomes theirs.
The game ends when one of the courses has control of 70% of all the buildings, or after a given time with the winning
team being the one that has the most locations claimed.

The location of the hidden areas can change randomly.

== Getting Started

* Create an account with our server (URL to be determined)
* Download the KingApp 
* Login in inside the app and start looking for the hidden locations
